From that simple act came a larger realisation: most plates were never created to reflect the way many of us eat—with structure, with balance, and shaped by the needs of different meals, eating styles and cultures.</p><p>What began as one design found resonance far beyond a single table. We discovered that tableware can be more than functional—it can embody tradition, embrace neurodivergent needs, and create belonging where it was missing. Today, Feenie’s Table exists to fill that absence. Through thoughtful function and design that adapts, we honour every meal, every style, every culture—and invite a community to gather around it.</p>"
